/*This class is here to abstract the graph representation. All I/O interactions with graphs should be called through here.

potential methods required:
-load - constructor that would retrieve graph data from storage
-create - make a new graph
-get - could have a bunch of types of this to get all sorts, whole graph, individual edges, individual vertices,
labels, properties, etc
-set - as with get, bunch of use cases here, setting edges, setting vertices, setting labels/properties
-save - store graph in a file
-traverse - should take an automaton as input, the output could be variable, or set to a certain type

in the case of moving from one graph to another, should this stay instantiated but be cleared? should it be destroyed?
probably the latter right?
