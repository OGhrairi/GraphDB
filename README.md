# GraphDB - Final Year Project
Broadly speaking, this project is an implementation of a graph database system. My MVP aim is to implement either conjunctive or regular path queries on a directed, labelled graph, and return only existential information about the query.

Post MVP Features:

- CRPQ (conjunctive regular path query) functionality
- full property graph model
- persistent file storage for graphs
- code optimisations
