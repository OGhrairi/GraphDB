# GraphDB - Final Year Project
Broadly speaking, this project is an implementation of a graph database system. My MVP aim is to implement either conjunctive or regular path queries on a directed, labelled graph, and return only existential information about the query.

## Current Progress
- v2 of graph representation - object oriented model which takes inspiration from linked lists in storing edge and vertex relationships. Not full property graph model as of yet
- v2 of query implementation - fairly naive search methods based on edge labels, can handle single edges, transitive closures, edge reversals, and can concatenate a mixture of those results into a full path, which then displays all pairs that are joined by said path
- v0.5 of query handling - current implementation is very simple iteration through a query string and splitting sequence of labels into individual steps for the above query. Cannot currently handle nesting of labels or operators. Work being done to replace this with flexible recursive search language generated by an ANTLR grammar.




Post MVP Features:

- CRPQ (conjunctive regular path query) functionality
- full property graph model
- persistent file storage for graphs
- code optimisations
